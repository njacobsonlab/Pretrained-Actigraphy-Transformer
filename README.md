# Is Attention All You Need For Actigraphy? Pre-trained Transformers for Wearable Accelerometer Data 

Abstract... blah blabh

# Demo Notebooks Below: 
## ‚≠ê How to Fine-tune ALBERT + How to use built-in Model Explainability: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sub_5m6fV91GbqEOWT8Sl5RjwN2QnhNh?usp=sharing

This notebook will walk you through: 
* Setting up (importing/connecting to TPU)
* Loading demo data
* Loading model
* Finetuning model
* Evaluating model
* Model Explainability 




You have to connect to TPUv2, or this will NOT work <be>  
Go to runtime->change runtime type <br>
Then select TPUv2 <br>
However, this should already be the default setting when you open the link.
